# Roundabout

> Roundabout allows the creation of short lived presigned URLs for content stored in web3.storage buckets (in R2). It can also get the HTTP request redirected to the given presigned URL.

## HTTP API

The given API is currently public.

### `GET /{cid}`

Redirects to a presigned URL where the requested CAR file (by its CID) can be downloaded from. The given CID can be the CAR CID, or an equivalent CID to it, such as a PieceCIDv2. The request will return a `302 Redirect` to a created presigned URL.

It also supports a query parameter `expires` with the number of seconds this presigned URL should be valid for. You can set a value from one second to 7 days (604,800 seconds). By default the expiration is set for 3 days (259,200 seconds).

### `GET /key/{key}?bucket=bucket-name`

> Deprecated and should not be used in production

Redirects to a presigned URL where the requested bucket value can be downloaded from by its key. Unlike `GET /{carCid}`, this endpoint takes a key and is compatible with any web3.storage account bucket. The request will return a `302 Redirect` to a created presigned URL.

It also supports a query parameter `expires` with the number of seconds this presigned URL should be valid for. You can set a value from one second to 7 days (604,800 seconds). By default the expiration is set for 3 days (259,200 seconds).

Note that there is a bucket list of accepted buckets.

## Usage

### Download CAR file via CURL

```console
curl -L -v https://roundabout.web3.storage/bagbaiera222226db4v4oli5fldqghzgbv5rqv3n4ykyfxk7shfr42bfnqwua --output bagbaiera222226db4v4oli5fldqghzgbv5rqv3n4ykyfxk7shfr42bfnqwua.car
```

### Get presigned URL for CAR file via CURL

For some use cases, just getting a presigned URL to use later might be needed. Therefore, it is also possible to rely on a HEAD request to get the presigned URL present in the `location` header of the response.

```console
curl --head https://roundabout.web3.storage/bagbaiera222226db4v4oli5fldqghzgbv5rqv3n4ykyfxk7shfr42bfnqwua
